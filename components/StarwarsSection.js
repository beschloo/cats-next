                        Whiskers, the cat, with fur as red as fire,
                        Fell in love with crypto, its allure and attire.
                        He roamed through the networks, with grace and with glee,
                        In search of the secrets, that only crypto could see.
                    </p>
                    <p className=''>
                        With a flick of his tail, and a sparkle in his eye,
                        He learned of the mysteries that lay up high,
                        Of blockchains and hashes, and digital wealth,
                        And knew he had found his true self.
                    </p>
                    <p className=''>
                        He purred with delight, as he mined for more,
                        Of this digital gold, that lay in store,
                        He traded and hodled, and never did sell,
                        For in crypto he found, true happiness and well.
                    </p>
                    <p className=''>
                        So if you ever see, Whiskers in the night,
                        With a smile on his face, and a purr just right,
                        Remember that love, can come from surprise,
                        And a cat with whiskers, found love in the crypto skies.
